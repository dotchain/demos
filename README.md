[![Status](https://travis-ci.com/dotchain/demos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dotchain/demos?branch=master)

## ES6 TodoMVC

The ES6 todo MVC implementation based on [dotjs](https://github.com/dotchain/dotjs) illustrates how to use streams for simpler programming.

Note that this demo requires a local server at localhost:8080/dotjs/demo but the demo works with out a server (just won't show collaboration).

The demo also uses standard ES6 React though this is overkill for this project.
